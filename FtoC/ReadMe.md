- defined function FtoC as c = (f - 32) 5/9 and return c 
- created variable f = 99 
- created variable c = FtoC(f)
- SyntaxError: Unexpected Number 
- added * to function before 5/9 
- tried to run nothing happened, forgot to console.log
- added console.log(c) 
- program runs. 
- added c.toFixed(2) for cleaner look 
- consulted older brother just in case, he recomended to add strings "ºF is " and "ºC" to console.log line for cleaner look and more fun :)
